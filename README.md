# A MIDI Visualizer and editor.
Just making for fun and curiosity of how MIDI works.

There is still a bunch to do.

### Planned features:
  - Midi editing and saving.
  - Midi playback.
  - Ability to assign any samples for any midi track.
  - [MAYBE] Make a module for easy custom Sys Ex Instruction specs that are meant for more advanced hardware MIDI players and such.
  - Separate into modules and make the CORE independent to be compilable into CLI MIDI analyzer.
  - And some other things if I come up with anything, idk.
